/**
 * Operations on a window layout.
 *
 * Every function here is pure: it takes a tree and returns a new one, which is
 * what lets the layout be a `v-model`, be persisted, and be tested without a
 * DOM. The interesting decisions live in `insertPanel` and `normalizeLayout` —
 * between them they keep the tree as flat as the arrangement looks on screen,
 * so a row of three panels is three siblings rather than a staircase of nested
 * splits that resize strangely.
 *
 * A leaf is a *group*: one space shared by one or more panels as tabs. A lone
 * panel is a group of one, so nothing here needs a separate notion of a tab.
 * A tab is a panel id, or — where a space shares the strip beside one — a node
 * like any other: `isPanelTab` is the difference, and every function below
 * looks through a space tab the way it looks through a split's children.
 *
 * A *float* is the third kind: frames that overlap the space instead of
 * dividing it. Every function below treats a float's frames the way it treats
 * a split's children — the difference between the two is where they are drawn,
 * not what may be put in them.
